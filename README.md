# Chaallonge
A browser extension to help TOs seed local brackets of various sizes by further integrating Challonge with Braacket's stat-tracking system. 

## Motivation
I organize free weekly tournaments for UW Smash Club and kept running into seeding issues due to sudden influxes of new players and high enough playercounts that make seeding well AND quickly difficult to do in a pinch. The ultimate goal is to create something that helps avoid repeated matchups early in bracket, early "teamkills", and is minimal enough to use in presentation that TOs just getting into the swing of things can easily pick up and use.
